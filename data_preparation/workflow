While the scripts will be put into one programm in the future
1. format_pdb.py unzips and takes the first deposited model and also morphs them into CYANA readable files
2. the next step is to run pdbGetDistanceInfo.py but since we do not upload the necessary classes here it is not useful.
3. then depending on whether we have an alphafold structure run aligner_AF and just aligner for normal pdb data.
4. once you have the graphs use, sort mono_poly.py to get a folder with only monomers
5. now use sort_same_graphs.py to match the AF structure and the NMR structure to get a ready dataset for training.


the pdb id folder then has file for matching bmrb and pdb data and uniprot ids for our proteins
you can also download fasta sequences using the script therein possibly for alphafold predictions
